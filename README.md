Searches and Sorts

I implemented some of the more popular sort and search algorithms with generics just for practice. I provided algorithm explanations and complexities in the method headers to help out.

I also have extensive commenting in some places just to help refresh the inner workings of the algorithm for myself at a quick glance.  
 
For the sake of testing I also created a quick Tree and Node class to use with the Depth first and Breadth First Searches.
